# Repository for Temporary Keeping Files
## 🧪 Experimental & Unorganized projects

This directory contains a collection of experimental, work-in-progress, and temporary projects developed during my studies and practice at 42 and beyond.
These are not yet fully structured or documented but serve as a sandbox for testing ideas, learning new concepts, or prototyping solutions.

## 🚧 Contents

- Draft code snippets
- Incomplete mini-projects
- Experiments with system programming, scripting, algorithms, graphics, etc.

## 🔍 Purpose

To keep track of progress, explore new topics, and iterate on ideas before organizing them into standalone repositories.

## 📌 Note

These projects may contain incomplete implementations, unrefined code, or missing documentation. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
